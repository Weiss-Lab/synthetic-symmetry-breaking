This code, flow cytometry data, and images accompany "Synthetic symmetry breaking and programmable multicellular structure formation",
a manuscript published in Cell Systems.

Analysis was performed in MATLAB and ImageJ. 

MATLAB flow cytometry analysis pipeline was written by Breanna DiAndreth and made available to Noreen Wauford, who wrote the code
and performed analysis. MATLAB flow cytometry analysis functions require downloading the MATLAB pipeline and modifying the variable
"flow_analysis_code_path" to the local copy of the pipeline.

MATLAB image analysis requires ColorBrewer, available from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/45208-colorbrewer-attractive-and-distinctive-colormaps.
MATLAB image analysis functions require modifying the variable "fex_code_path" to the local copy of cbrewer.
